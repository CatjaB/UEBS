    "# How to complete an assignment:\n",
    "    \n",
    "This assignment prepares you for the final project, which will take place in a few weeks. While the final project will be a longer report, here you will write a number of very very short mini-reports (7-8 sentences each). Each mini-report will describe how you solved a simple business problem by analysing data with python code. Mini-report and your code will me marked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find two datasets. Solve TWO tasks for each dataset. **That's 4 tasks in total.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### For each task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. look at the data and identify a business problem that you are solving using the data you were given\n",
    "2. write python code that takes data from the online source and manipulates them in a way that solves the problem or answers the question. Use only libraries and skills that you learned during this course so far. (do not use: Numpy/Panda/ML/visualisation etc)\n",
    "3. Write up a MINI-REPORT for each problem as 3 short paragraphs \n",
    "\n",
    "Each mini-report (150-200 words long) will include 3 short paragraphs, each 2-3 sentences long. This is super short, so that you write down to the point and just what's important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short Paragraph 1 - Problem: What problem you are solving and how you will solve it with data.\n",
    "- Short Paragraph 2 - Analysis & Results: What analysis you prefromed in your python code and what were the results\n",
    "- Short Paragraph 3 - Solution: What is the solution to the problem, and how your analysis helped you to solve it\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given a mark out of 100 points for each dataset, following the marking criteria on Learn. Marks will be for the quality of your python code and your explanation of the problem you solved (mini-report), and how you used data to solve it. Extra points will not be given for the complexity of the problem, so no need to make it very very convoluted, but if your solution is too simple, you might not give yourself an opportunity to showcase yoru python skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is ok when the tasks share some of the same code where appropriate. Just make sure your minireports are separate from each other and clearly signposted, and it's clear on which code they report."

Group movies into 3 groups by \"imdb rating\": mediocre (below 7), good (7-8), amazing (8 and over). Extra: What is the average lengtht of a movie in each group? Are longer movies higher rated?

Look at the forecast data and extract 'daily_chance_of_rain' and 'moon_illumination' values. Then present the information about next 10 days. Suggest the day when it's least likely to rain and one when the moon is brightest. Extra: Because of security reasons the castle needs to close at midnight - assuming the photoshoot needs to happen at least an hour after sunset, and once the moon has risen, how much time would they have each night to perform the photoshoot?
